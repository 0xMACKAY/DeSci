# DeSci Stack

## What is the DeSci Stack?

Decentralized science (DeSci) is a transformative movement in the scientific domain. It seeks to construct a public infrastructure that leverages the Web3 stack for various scientific activities, including funding, creation, review, credit allocation, storage, and dissemination of knowledge. 

### Key Points:
- **Openness**: DeSci promotes the idea that scientific knowledge should be universally accessible.
- **Transparency**: The process of scientific research should be transparent, ensuring that every step, from hypothesis formulation to data collection, is open for scrutiny.
- **Decentralization**: By decentralizing access to resources and communication channels, DeSci aims to reduce the influence of central authorities, thereby fostering an environment where innovative ideas can thrive.
